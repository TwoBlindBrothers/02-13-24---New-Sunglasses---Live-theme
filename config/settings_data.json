When we can&#x27;t see something, we trust the people around us, and nearly always, we find that people love to help each other. To do this, we’ve temporarily adjusted our website so that you won’t be able to see any of the items we normally sell; all you’ll be able to see is discounted price points. If you are worried about what you are going to get, we can make you two promises - #1 You&#x27;ll love what you get. Trust us :) Hint: These are our best and newest items. (They aren&#x27;t size dependent). And, #2 You&#x27;ll be helping to cure blindness because 100% of all profits go to pre-clinical researchers for eye disease. Finally, if you don&#x27;t like what you get, you can always return it, no questions asked.<\/p>"}},"ca0f1c20-7e10-4104-9a9e-76ce93041162":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"Who are you guys?","answer":"<p>We’re Bryan and Bradford Manning, the founders of Two Blind Brothers.
